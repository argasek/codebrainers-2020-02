// Task 1. Find a way to render HTML code in such way that white space characters are preserved during render.
// Protip: go Google.
// Protip 2: use keywords contained in the task description ;-)

// Task 2.
// Create separate components for Plants, Rooms and Categories. I.e. Plants component would contain this JSX:
//
//   <h1>Plants</h1>
//   <div>
//     { plants.map((item) => <div>{item}</div>) }
//     <input type="text" />
//   </div>
//
// Obviously, please take "plants" in this component as a prop passed to the component.


// Task 3.
// Each of the Plants, Rooms and Categories component should have the ability to add new plant, room or category in
// the state (respectively).

// Task 4.
// As a minimum implementation, plants, categories and rooms should be arrays of strings. However, to accomplish
// Task 4, make them objects with own models (i.e. Plant, Category, Room).

// Task 5.*
// Think of a way to reduce number of boilerplate code that would be required to implement tasks (2-4).
